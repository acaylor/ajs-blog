This site is a personal blog focused on software, technology, and [the cloud][1]. The main purpose of this blog is to share what technology I am working with at home.

### Author

![author](/images/whoami/whoami.png)

I am a Cloud Systems Engineer. I enjoy working with the latest technology in my homelab. This image was generated with AI DALLE.

My career has been focused on managing networked computer systems to support business applications with a focus on security and scalability. In the past five years I have worked remotely and exclusively in cloud environments which allows me to live anywhere.

At home though I am usually the only user of services which is why there may be a lack of tooling around Role Based Access Control. As a single user, I rely on a password/secret manager to keep credentials secure.
