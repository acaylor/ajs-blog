My homelab has evolved quite a bit over time. After implementing a [wiki][1], I have tracked servers and services deployed there. In 2023 I have not done much in the homelab because I moved across my country. Fortunately the only equipment that died during the move was a Raspberry Pi 3b.

Last "homelab update" post was [August 2022][2]


## 2023

Notable addition in 2023 was a migration from a Unifi USG to a Unifi UDM (Dream Machine Pro).
