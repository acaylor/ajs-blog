A new calendar year is already underway. My plans for the next year include projects related to what I am working on at my job. 

- I will be reviewing my observability stack and taking a look at OpenTelemetry. 
- I will also be testing some CI/CD tools.
- I think I will be overhauling my kubernetes environment again. I want something more simple but also maintain the goal of combining the resources of many low-power computers such as Raspberry Pi, Mac Mini, and small form factor desktop PCs.
- I will be trying to practice more software projects most likely in Python as that is one language with a large library my team maintains at work. I would like to learn some more full stack development with JavaScript or TypeScript. I have seen a lot of applications in my career that use this as a language for the entire application stack or most of it.

## Lab infrastructure

At the start of 2025, here is how the structure of my homelab looks:
