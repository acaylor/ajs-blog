Once there is more than one computer to worry about, having logs in one location to search for errors and troubleshoot applications becomes critical. In [a previous post][1] I set up prometheus to collect metrics and grafana to visualize the metrics. Today I am going to look at another tool from grafana called [loki][2]. Loki will provide a server to collect logs and we will install an agent on systems to send their logs to the loki server.

## Install loki on proxmox lxc

My monitoring software is on a raspberry pi system. This system uses a micro sd card as the file system storage. I am going to install loki on a more powerful system that has a ssd to support log storage.

I'm going to use an existing proxmox server and use a LXC container to host the loki server. If you are not familiar with lxc containers and proxmox, check out [a previous post][3] for an introduction. 

I am going to use an openSUSE container template because there is a package repository for installing loki on openSUSE.

### Download lxc template

Before creating the new container, download the image into proxmox storage. If youâ€™re unsure to which one, you can use the `local` storage. For clustered installations, it is preferred to use a shared storage so that all nodes can access those images. I will use NFS storage.

```bash
pveam update

pveam available |grep -i suse

system          opensuse-15.3-default_20210925_amd64.tar.xz

pveam download images opensuse-15.3-default_20210925_amd64.tar.xz
...
...
calculating checksum...OK, checksum verified
download of 'http://download.proxmox.com/images/system/opensuse-15.3-default_20210925_amd64.tar.xz' to '/mnt/pve/images/template/cache/opensuse-15.3-default_20210925_amd64.tar.xz' finished
```

Note `images` is the name of my NFS storage, replace this with one appropriate for your setup.

Now the image is available to deploy.

### Deploy lxc container with terraform

Let's deploy the lxc container for loki using terraform. If you are not familiar with terraform on proxmox, check out [a previous post][4] to get started.

Create a new `tf` file or add on to an existing one.

```tf
resource "proxmox_lxc" "loki_lxc" {
  target_node  = "hp"
  hostname     = "loki"
  cores        = 2
  memory       = 4096
  onboot       = true
  ostemplate   = "images:vztmpl/opensuse-15.3-default_20210925_amd64.tar.xz"
  unprivileged = true

  rootfs {
    storage = "local-lvm"
    size    = "100G"
  }

  network {
    name   = "eth0"
    bridge = "vmbr0"
    ip     = "dhcp"
  }
}
```

Create the container with terraform:

```
terraform apply

...
...
...
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

proxmox_lxc.loki_lxc: Creating...
proxmox_lxc.loki_lxc: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
proxmox_lxc.loki_lxc: Creation complete after 14s [id=pve/lxc/100]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Now, from the proxmox host, attach to the container and replace `<vmid>` with the id assigned to your lxc container:

```
lxc-attach <vmid>
```

Once connected to the container, add the repo for logging:

```bash
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/logging/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/security:logging.repo

zypper ref

...
Do you want to reject the key, trust temporarily, or trust always? [r/t/a/?] (r): a
```

Trust the gpg key for the repo by entering "a" and then install loki:

```bash
zypper in loki promtail -y
```

Once installed, we can start and enable the loki and promtail service:

```bash
systemctl enable --now loki
systemctl enable --now promtail
```

Now loki should be accessible on port 3100

### ansible playbook

Here is an ansible playbook to perform the previous steps. Check out a [previous post][5] if you are not familiar with ansible. The lxc container needs to have an ssh server and a non-root user with sudo access.

```bash
zypper in openssh-server

systemctl enable --now sshd
```

Simple playbook for opensuse leap 15.3

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: "Add logging repo to {{ ansible_hostname }}"
      community.general.zypper_repository:
        repo: 'https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/logging/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/security:logging.repo'
        auto_import_keys: yes
    - name: "Add loki packages"
      community.general.zypper:
        name:
          - loki
          - promtail
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
    - name: "Start loki services"
      systemd:
        name: loki
        state: started
        enabled: yes
    - name: "Start promtail service"
      systemd:
        name: promtail
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

Run this with the command

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i 'loki.server,'
```

## Configure promtail targets

Any system that you want to collect logs will need the promtail agent. I prefer this to using rsyslog because promtail can send logs over HTTPS which means logs will be encrypted in transit unlike with rsyslog which is not encrypted. To make loki more secure, use a reverse proxy for the plain text loki port 3100 to accept traffic from HTTPS port 443. Check out a [previous post][6] for how to set up a proxy server that can be configured through a portal.

There should be one promtail agent already on the lxc system where loki was installed. Before proceeding, verify that loki is operational. Log into another system that you would like to forward logs and see if loki is ready:

```bash
curl http://loki.server:3100/ready
ready
```

Now we will prepare a configuration file for the promtail agent on the remote server.

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/loki

vim /etc/loki/promtail-config.yaml
```

Replace the localhost url with your loki server.

```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
- job_name: system
  static_configs:
  - targets:
      - localhost
    labels:
      job: varlogs
      __path__: /var/log/*log
```

This will collect all .log files in `/var/log`. Now if you want to collect logs from docker containers, I found how to reconfigure the promtail agent and docker daemon to format the container logs. Loki includes a docker plugin to send logs but I run docker on raspberry pi systems which have arm64 cpu architecture. The loki docker plugin does not have an arm64 image but the promtail agent does.

We will prepare the promtail config and then configure the docker daemon to alter the format of the container logs to make it easier for us to look at in grafana. Repace the loki url with your system.


```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://loki.server:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
- job_name: containers
  static_configs:
  - targets:
      - localhost
    labels:
      job: containerlogs
      __path__: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*log

  pipeline_stages:
  - json:
      expressions:
        output: log
        stream: stream
        attrs:
  - json:
      expressions:
        tag:
      source: attrs
  - regex:
      expression: (?P<image_name>(?:[^|]*[^|])).(?P<container_name>(?:[^|]*[^|])).(?P<image_id>(?:[^|]*[^|])).(?P<container_id>(?:[^|]*[^|]))
      source: tag
  - timestamp:
      format: RFC3339Nano
      source: time
  - labels:
      tag:
      stream:
      image_name:
      container_name:
      image_id:
      container_id:
  - output:
      source: output
```

The promtail agent is available as a docker image. We can deploy this image with `docker-compose`. If you are not familiar with docker, check out a [previous post][6] to see how to run these containers. The section `logging` will demonstrate how we can configure new and existing containers to format their logs for loki.

`docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.0"
services:
  promtail:
    container_name: promtail
    image: grafana/promtail:2.3.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/docker/containers:/var/lib/docker/containers:ro
      - /etc/loki/promtail-config.yaml:/etc/promtail/promtail-config.yaml
    command: -config.file=/etc/promtail/promtail-config.yaml
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        tag: "{{.ImageName}}|{{.Name}}|{{.ImageFullID}}|{{.FullID}}"
```

## Visualize logs in grafana

Now that we have some logs going to loki, we can use grafana to view logs and perform queries to parse through the logs.
